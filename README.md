This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What's the purpose of this package?

This is a spotify clone that uses youtube as backend. It's my learning project for react.

### How does it work?

Python(FastAPI) is used in backend. It uses beatifulsoup module to fetch track url from youtube and gives to react-player.

### What is the fetching algorithm?

As simple as searching track artist + track title and returning first result from youtube.

### Why use web crawler instead of Google API?

Google limits the api very hard for free usage. It's a workaround for it and i must say it works pretty well
